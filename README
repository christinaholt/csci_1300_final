This package generates a Python interface to the NCEP NEMSIO library that is
used to read, and then plot a NEMSIO-formatted file for viewing atmospheric
fields at different levels.

Requirements:
  - conda installation.
      - Miniconda can be installed with a visit to https://conda.io/miniconda.html
      - Probably say no to allowing this install to edit your .bashrc and add
        the install path to your own .bashrc or $PATH manually.

**** BUILD THE NECESSARY LIBRARIES ****

    Once the repository has been cloned, the code can be built by simply typing
    these lines from the top-level of the clone:

        source build.sh
        build_all

    It's probably a good time to have a cup of coffee. This step takes 10-15 mins.

    The result of those actions will be the following:

        - A new conda environment named pynemsio will be generated. WARNING: If you
          already have a pynemsio conda environment installed, it WILL REMOVE IT. If
          this happens, you'll need to run build_all again.
        - The necessary NCEP libraries are built (out of source) with cmake in the
          src/nceplibs/build directory.
        - The nemsio_wrapper Fortran shared object (nemsio_wrapper.so) will be
          generated in the src/nemsio_wrapper directory


    Any of the functions available in build.sh can be called directly once the
    script has been sourced. A particularly helpfull function is clean_all, which
    removes the NCEP library build directory, the nemsio_wrapper.so (through it's
    Makefile), and the Conda environment pynemsio.

    NOTE: The build of the libraries, and the f2py build both generate many
    warnings, but these are compiler-related and are mostly innocuous. There are
    also a large block of warnings related to the OS Version near the end of the
    build. Those should be fine, too.

**** PLOTTING NEMSIO FILES ****

    Once the build has completed and nemsio_wrapper.so exists in
    src/nemsio_wrapper

        cd src/nemsio_wrapper

    There you will find plot_nemiso.py, a Python script that will plot a
    NEMSIO-formatted file.  Check out the usage of this file by typing

        python plot_nemsio.py -h

    The standard fields are surface pressure (psfc), temperature (tmp), U and V
    wind components (ugrd, vgrd), wind speed (wind), and specific humidity
    (spfh).

    Example: 

        python plot_nemsio.py -f gsi_anl -l 50 -p 8 -o anl

        Will use 8 processes to plot fields from file gsi_anl at every 50th
        level starting at 1, and write them to .png files with an anl prefix.

        python plot_nemsio.py -f gsi_anl gsi_bkg -l 50 -p 12 -o incr

        Will use 12 processes to plot the difference of fields in the files
        gsi_anl and gsi_bkg (this particular difference is known as analysis
        increment in data assimilation) at every 50th level starting at 1 and
        write them to .png files wint and incr prefix.


**** Additional Notes ****

    The NCEP libraries were obtained from a colleage's public Git repo and came
    ready-to-build with cmake. I included only a subset of those libraries
    necessary for this project in the code I turned in. You can access the full
    repo here:
